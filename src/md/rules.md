## Collective rules

We need more structure and better shared responsibility. We should define clear areas of responsibility and titles or roles. We will have one meeting per month that works as a "board meeting" where we follow a clear agenda and take effective executive decisions.

I think we should also make use of our actual association statutes to decide how we pick our "core team". So I propose that the core team that takes decisions is equal to the Vorstand we have already selected for a 2 year period. New people can still join our meetings, but they will not have voting power until they are also elected as Vorstand at our general assembly every 2 years. 

This type of collective organisation has been used for hundreds of years and is built to specifically be robust against disagreements. I think using it more will make for a good foundation against any internal conflicts or agenda takeover attempts.

Here follows my attempt at clearly outlining these rules in easy to read English.

- Queer Haus Core Team (Vorstand)
    - Core team is elected by the collective members at the general assembly on a 2 year period
    - The Core Team makes decisions and delegates work on behalf of the collective
    - Current Core Team: Barbs, Lally, Pedro, Sophie, Vincent
- Queer Haus Collective Members (Mitglieder)
    - Collective members have voting rights at the general assembly every 2 years
    - Requests to become a member are sent to the core team. The core team can deny these requests without giving any reason.
    - Current Collective Members: Barbs, Lally, Landon, Maria, Pedro, Sophie, Vincent
- Queer Haus Moderation Team
    - Moderation team has access to:
        -  All posts and users of queer.haus through the moderation interface (cannot see direct messages)
        -  Collective email account queerhaus@protonmail.com
        -  Collective queer.haus account @dolphin
    - New moderators are appointed by the Core Team
    - Current Moderation Team: Barbs, Lally, Pedro, Sophie, Vincent
- Queer Haus Admin Team
    - Admin team is trusted with full admin access to our servers and all data
    - Core Team decides who we trust with full admin access
    - Current Admin Team: Barbs, Vincent


- General meeting rules
    - Meetings should not be scheduled for longer than 1,5 hours
    - We wait maximum 15 minutes for late arrivals, be on time!
    - Meeting room link is not public and only sent privately to those we invite
    - Core team must approve every new person that is invited to meetings
- Monthly core meeting happens on the __first__ Saturday every month
    - All core team members _should_ participate when possible
    - A majority of core team members _must_ be present so we reach quorum (over 50% of core team , currently min __3 people__)
    - If quorum is not reached, the meeting must be adjourned and rescheduled
    - On divisive issues, every core team member gets an equal vote
    - The agenda is prepared and made available to team members at least 5 days beforehand
- Weekly core meeting every Saturday
    - Participate as you have time, no strict requirements
    - These meetings are thematically focused work meetings such as tech or design
- Our associations statutes ([Vereinssatzung](https://codimd.queer.haus/verein)) takes precedence over these additional rules
- Changing these additional rules requires a proposal and agreement at a monthly meeting

## Repeating agendas for weekly and monthly meeting

Having repeating regular items on the agenda each meeting can help us create structure and be more efficient. Here are some ideas for what that could be.

- We can also start with just going around the table and letting everyone talk
- Regular agenda for monthly meeting
    - Greetings and mood check (max 15 min wait)
    - Community manager report
    - System admin report
    - Treasurer report
    - Public relations report
    - Decide on proposals
    - Put decisions in Trello cards
    - ?
- Regular agenda for weekly meeting
    - Greetings and mood check (max 15 min wait)
    - We go around the table and let everyone give a quick update about their actions this week
    - Trello sync
    - What happened on queer.haus this week?
    - Proceed with set theme for meeting
