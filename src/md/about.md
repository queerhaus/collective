## Who we are

We are a group of Berlin queers with a burning desire to create a social media space where we queers and sex workers are free to share what we want without fear of getting blocked. We know that many platforms sell our data, surveil our profiles and monitor our relations. This is a place to organise ourselves, a place of queer knowledge and community.

This website is our planet in the distributed social media network called "the fediverse". Much like email where you are free to choose your own provider like gmail or hotmail, with the fediverse you are free to choose your own community in this network. Each community often has it's own servers and can have its own rules and policies.

We are NOT building a new centralised and monetised app. We want to break away from monopolistic corporate structures. We want to help build a new type of internet governed by smaller communities instead of profit driven companies. This is our space, where we get to define our own identity. This is where we make our own rules.

No monitoring. No ads. No censorship. No data collection. 

Costs are covered by donations. Systems are maintained by a small volountary team of queers. This process will be imperfect and we plan to improve as we go. This is a labour of love from volunteers and an ongoing experiment. 



## Code of conduct

We aspire for this space to be a place of queer experimentation, utopian thought, social critique, collective organising, and lots of self affirming nudity!

Here all nipples are welcome and can be freely posted with the consent of the people in the picture. You are even free to post all of your sexiness, just be sure to mark it as "sensitive", so you let others consent to viewing it.

Try to be mindful of others: their experience or inexperience, privilege or lack thereof. No Body Police: Bodies are political. No Grammar Police: Language is political. 

This is no space for hate speech, bullying, trolling, hostility or any of the following: 
Racism ~ Ageism ~ Sexism ~ Ableism ~ Classism ~ Fatphobia ~ Colourism ~ Classism ~ SWERFS (Sex worker exclusionary radical feminism) ~ Homophobia ~ Biphobia ~ Transphobia ~ TERFS (trans-exclusionary radical feminism)
